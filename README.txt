Esolangs.org has many languages.

I'm going to implement them all*.

The folder name is the same as the wiki title (after /wiki/)

Though this code is "licensed" under the Unlicense,
I'd still appreciate credit (or just a GitHub star!)

also markdown is hard to do when half your keyboard
doesn't work and you have to use the on-screen keyboard
for half the keys, so you aren't allowed to complain
that this is a TXT.

Special thanks to the entirety of esolangs.org for
being CC0.

*Unimplementable programs not included, obviously.
